                Mandela was born into the Madiba clan in the village of Mvezo, in the Eastern Cape, on 18 July 1918. His
                mother was Nonqaphi Nosekeni and his father was Nkosi Mphakanyiswa Gadla Mandela, principal counsellor
                to the Acting King of the Thembu people, Jongintaba Dalindyebo. In 1930, when he was 12 years old, his
                father died and the young Rolihlahla became a ward of Jongintaba at the Great Place in Mqhekezweni1
